# bunq-hackathon solution
We want to share our solution we made with Mendix during the very first bunq hackathon the 1st of September this year [https://www.bunq.com/bunqhackathon](https://www.bunq.com/bunqhackathon). 

**bunq** is planning a second hackathon so you can use our solution as a working example to kickstart your solution or create awesome business apps as well with the API of bunq.

Together with the team of Appronto we created a better payment experience with zero click iDeal payments!

We achieved this by reduced amount of steps in the current process.

Now you need a device like your phone, an identifier, random readers to approve your payment

What if you don't need that anymore? We present the revolutionary zero-click experience 🚀

We allow people to set up a personal limit so everything below that limit will automagically approved.

We believe that with this revolutionary zero-click experience every bunqer will save time they can spend on doing what they love instead.

You can find the source code of the browser plugin here on GitHub: [https://github.com/appronto/bunq](https://github.com/appronto/bunq)

Enjoy and let us know if this app is also helping you deliver great business apps as well !

Cheers! 🍻

Team Appronto


##### DISCLAIMER:
> Because we made this during a hackathon we took shortcuts to deliver with the speed of light. Therefore we want to let you know that some functionalities can be better designed but it was made to proof the zero-click-payment experience. Using this plugin is on your own risk. Protect your API key of your bunq account as good as possible. We do not encrypt any API keys but it should be a best practice to do so..
